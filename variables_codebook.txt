The "avgMeasures.txt" file goal was to make a tidy data set with explicit variables names and no intermediate variables or data sets.
In that sense the "avgMeasures.txt" variables are : 

[1]  "feature"
      Features measurements names which come from the original core features names but without any triaxial specicifaction if applied,
      17 possibilities :
                        tBodyAcc
                        tGravityAcc
                        tBodyAccJerk
                        tBodyGyro
                        tBodyGyroJerk
                        tBodyAccMag
                        tGravityAccMag
                        tBodyAccJerkMag
                        tBodyGyroMag
                        tBodyGyroJerkMag
                        fBodyAcc
                        fBodyAccJerk
                        fBodyGyro
                        fBodyAccMag
                        fBodyAccJerkMag
                        fBodyGyroMag
                        fBodyGyroJerkMag

[2]  "estimateparameter"
      Axies specification from triaxial measurement for some concerned "feature". "feature" where axial measurement is out-of-context are fill with NAs values,
      4 possibilities :
                        X
                        Y
                        Z
                        NA
                              
[3]  "estimate"
      Mean and standard deviation of Samsung signals calculations made for each "feature" which come from the original source,
      2 possibilities :
                        mean()
                        std()
                        
[4]  "activity"
      Activity name perfomed by subject during "feature" measurements which come from the original source,
      6 possibilities :
                        WALKING
                        WALKING_UPSTAIRS
                        WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
                        SITTING
                        STANDING
                        LAYING
                        
[5]  "subjectid"
      Number id for each of the 30 subject which come from the original source,
      30 possibilities :
                        from 1 to 30 //not displayed since it's obsious and will waste space

[6]  "mean(value)"
      Average value of each "feature" for either each triaxial measurement or none triaxial specification, each "activity" and each "subjectid",
      11 880 observations :
                            8 triaxial features
                          * 3 axes
                          + (17-8) none-axial features
                          ____________________________
                            33 features
                          * 2 estimates
                          * 6 activities
